# Kobold License - v1.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE DOCUMENT.  
ANY USE, REDISTRIBUTION, OR MODIFICATION, BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE, CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE WITH ALL TERMS SPECIFIED WITHIN THIS DOCUMENT.

## Preamble

Kobold is an open source project that encourages experimentation and usage of it. We believe that by making software publically viewable, that it may encourage and strengthen both our growth and allow for others to use its ideas in ones own works. However, in order to protect original property, while allowing flexibility of redistribution and modification, it becomes neccesary to include a license document to ensure that the author(s) recieve the credit they deserve as well as any other conditions they believe are just in order to protect their property.

Many other licenses were considered prior to this one, and the decision to write a new license from scratch was not one that was easily taken. However, we believe that by creating this document, that we will be able to protect what is ours while still providing lots of flexibility with others who want to modify and/or redistribute this program.  
We are by no means lawyers, and it is possible that this document may not be perfect. If you believe there are any issues or loopholes that we did not find, we encourage you to open a pull request at https://github.com/TalonFloof/Kobold. This license is by no means a complete and ratified document and we are always open to have others help improve this document.
